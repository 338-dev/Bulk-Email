    <p>Dear {{name}},</p>
    
    <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer role at <span class="highlight">{{company}}</span>. With my skills and experience in Web Development, I believe I would be a valuable asset to your team.</p>
    
    <p>I have <span class="highlight">nearly 2 years of experience</span> as a Software Developer and more than <span class="highlight">1.2 years of experience</span> in Software development as an Intern. I am proficient in front-end development technologies, including ReactJS, React Native, Next.Js, Redux, JavaScript, and TypeScript and also have experience with backend technologies such as Node.js, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, and Express.js.</p>
    
    <p>Presently, I am serving as a <span class="highlight">Software Engineer at Square Yards</span>, where I work on Full-Stack development. Here, I contribute to the CredIQ project where I work on multiple codebases and create and integrate APIs into our system. I have integrated third-party APIs from ICICI, Piramal Finance Limited, ART Finance, and Transunion CIBIL into the CredIQ system, which facilitates the Home loan process for users, and developed various screens for this purpose. I am also good at DSA and problem-solving and am a fast learner. I achieved the <span class="highlight">highest rating of 1811 (4 stars) on CodeChef</span>.</p>
    
    <p>Previously, I worked as an SDE Intern for BITCS, contributing to the development of Matrimilan, A matrimonial app based on React Native Expo.</p>
    
    <p>I worked on a Gym management app called Fitness Freak based on React Native for a client where I developed the entire app from scratch. Moreover, I have completed several personal full-stack projects, such as a real-time collaborative whiteboard, bike reservation system, event management system, assessment app, real-time web chat application, and property rental website.</p>
    
    <p>I look forward to the possibility of joining <span class="highlight">{{company}}</span> and contributing to its growth. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
